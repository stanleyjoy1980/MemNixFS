// forensic_warmer.h — background pre-warming of expensive-but-small VFS files.
//
// Forensic mode trades a bit of background CPU for instant browsing. After the
// VFS tree is built, the warmer walks it, finds every file node whose
// FileCost says `worth_warming()` (expensive to compute, small in memory), and
// runs each producer on a small thread pool so the node's cache is populated
// before the user opens it. Mount is NOT blocked — warming runs in the
// background, and a file opened before it's warmed simply computes on demand
// (same per-node cache, so no double work).
//
// Thread-safety: producers read the engine's shared state, which is already
// concurrency-safe — kva_reader uses atomics, the socket index uses
// std::call_once, kallsyms is built at open (read-only thereafter), and YARA
// 4.x scans the shared YR_RULES with an internally-created per-call scanner.
// Each LazyFileNode guards its own load with a mutex, so a node being warmed
// while simultaneously opened by a WinFsp dispatcher is safe.
